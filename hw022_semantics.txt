Declaration semantics:
The compiler recognizes the datatype and writes bytecode that causes the JVM to
reserve certain of memory based on the datatype. If the variable is a field, it
is initialized  with a zero-like value. The name becomes associated with a
chunk of memory.

Assignment semantics:
The JVM copies the value of the expression on the RHS and stores that value
into the chunk of memory associated with the variable on the LHS

Retrieval semantics:
When Java retrieves the value of a variable in an expression, Java finds the
chunk of memory allocated to that variable and replaces the variable with the
value stored in the reference.
