Python:

def sum(A, B):
    return A + B

def  the keyword for defining a function
sum  function name
(    meaning of left-parenthesis to the language processor, separator marking the start of the list of parameters
A B  parameters
,    separator separating the parameters
)    meaning of right-parenthesis to the language processor, marking the end of of the list of parameters
:    separator marking the start of the content of the function
return returns the value that follows when the function is invoked

sum(2,3)
sum call the function
() marking its a invocation instead of finding the location of the function
2 3 parameters passed to the function
, separator

when the function is invoked, the python interpreter finds the function and passes the copy of the parameters.
Then the procedure in the function is followed to return a result based on the input parameters.
The result returned is then passed to the locations of the invocation of the function and replaces the invocation.
