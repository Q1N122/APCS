New operator Semantics
The JVM instantiates a class by dynamically allocating memory for a new object
and returning a reference to that memory. (GeekForGeeks)

Combo Semantics
The compiler recognizes the datatype and writes bytecode that causes the JVM to
reserve certain of memory based on the datatype. If the variable is a field, it
is initialized  with a zero-like value. The name becomes associated with a
chunk of memory.
Then, the JVM  Copy the value of each argument from the invocation into the
corresponding parameter of the method. Execute the statements in the method,
using the copied values. When a return expression is executed, the value of
expression replaces the invocation which gets stored into the chunk of memory
associated with the variable on the LHS
